Doesn't seem to matter what I do
I'm always number two
No one knows how hard I tried,
I have feelings that I can't explain
Drivin' me insane
All my life, been so polite
But I'll sleep alone tonight

'Cause I'm just Ken
Anywhere else I'd be a ten
Is it my destiny
To live
And die a life of blonde fragility?
I'm just Ken
Where I see love, she sees a friend
What will it take for her to see
The man behind the tan
And fight for me?

I wanna know what itâ€™s like to love
To be the real thing
Is it a crime?
Am I not hot
When I'm in my feelings?
And is my moment finally here or am I dreaming?
I'm no dreamer

Can you feel the Ken-ergy?
